My attempt at making ![atomic14's USB cable tester](https://github.com/atomic14/usb-tester) from scratch. It took a while to find a a fully featured USB-C cable, to the point where I was getting a bit concerned that my board was not working, despite my testing it properly. I eventually bought one which worked perfectly.
